# 3Input - A Daemonized Input Viewer

3Input is an input viewer that works behind the scenes on your 3DS. Much like [HorizonMod](https://github.com/Bas25/HorizonMod), the goal is to run as a daemoized process/background utility, which you can then use a client to connect to and read your inputs.

## Features
The current features are not that much. Currently you can launch the application, and use the Python TK viewer to see the input on your PC. 

## Contributors/Credit
- [N3rds](https://github.com/n3rdswithgame) for the entirety of the old codebase. Since then I've been going through and documenting as much as I can to get a further understanding of the codebase itself.
- [leoetlino](https://github.com/leoetlino) for helping with allocation heap and helping with the sysmodule.

## Building
 - Install [devkitPro](http://devkitpro.org/) 3DS tools.
 - `make`
